Important points :-

1. I have chosen frontend in this assignment.

2. There will be an upload button. Upon clicking it, the user will be able to browse single/multiple files. The choosen files will be shown in the listbox.

3. Accepted file formats to upload is kept as '.txt' now, which can be configured in the future based on requirements.

4. The user will be able to download the file if he/she clicks on the listitems displayed.
